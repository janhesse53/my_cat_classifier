# Cat Classifier App

## Overview
Welcome to the Cat Classifier app, a fun and simple tool designed to help guests identify two adorable cats, Appa and Momo, by simply using their photos. This project is aimed at providing a quick and easy way for guest to distinguish between my two British Shorthair cats. 

The classifier is optimized to recognize images where the cat's face is fairly centered. It only works if one cat is visible in the image.

## How It Works
The app utilizes a machine learning model built with the Fastai library, trained on numerous images of Appa and Momo on Kaggle. By uploading or taking an image of either cat, the app can quickly tell you which cat is in the picture, along with the confidence level of its prediction.

## Deployment
This app is also deployed online with streamlit for easy access. Just open the provided URL on your smartphone, upload or take an image of the cat you want to identify, and get the results instantly.
